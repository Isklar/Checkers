# Checkers
An Arduino control program written in C for a checkers/draughts playing robot

This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, good code. Its intentionally written in a single file and unintentionally written badly.
Its likely this is not the final version and is simply here because it was once useful to me. If you're from Kent University dont copy this (not that you would want to anyway), you'll get done for plagurism.
However, somewhere in this mess is some useful examples of direct serial communications to an arduino using a COM port.
